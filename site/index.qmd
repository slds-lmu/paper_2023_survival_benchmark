This site aggregates additional results and metadata accompanying the benchmark project.

All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/slds-lmu/paper_2023_survival_benchmark).

Note that this page belongs to the most recent version of the project. A previous version from 2024 is [available here](https://projects.lukasburk.de/survival_benchmark_2024).

## Downloading Results

Results can be downloaded from [the web](https://projects.lukasburk.de/survival_benchmark/results/).

Files are suffixed with the associated tuning measure unless already combined, where `harrell_c,isbs` indicates results for learners which are not at all or not explicitly tuned during the experiment but rather use an internal mechanism, i.e. Kaplan-Meier or CoxBoost (see learner table on [Metadata](metadata.qmd))

- `scores` are individual scores per outer resampling iteration
- `bma_` (`BenchmarkAggr`) are intermediate results and are only relevant if these `mlr3` objects are specifically required.

See also [the table of measures](metadata.qmd) for a list of measures and their abbreviated and full names.


| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`scores.rds`][scores_rds]            | Scores for all learners, tasks and measures for individual outer resampling iterations |
| [`archives.zip`][archive_zip]         | ZIP file of all tuning archives produced during the benchmark (over 19000) in CSV files for each combination of learner, task, tuning measure, and resampling iteration |
