This site aggregates additional results and metadata accompanying the benchmark project.

All code is available on [GitHub at slds-lmu/paper_2023_survival_benchmark](https://github.com/slds-lmu/paper_2023_survival_benchmark).

## Downloading Results

Results can be downloaded from [the web at](https://projects.lukasburk.de/survival_benchmark/results/).
The files required to produce primary results are given in @tbl-files-results

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`aggr_scores.rds`][aggr_scores_rds]  | Scores for all learners, tasks and measures aggregated across outer resampling iterations |
| [`aggr_scores.csv`][aggr_scores_csv]  | The same data in portable CSV format |
| [`scores.rds`][scores_rds]            | Scores for all learners, tasks and measures for individual outer resampling iterations |
| [`scores.csv`][scores_csv]            | The same data in CSV format |
| [`archives.zip`][archive_zip]         | ZIP file of all tuning archives produced during the benchmark (over 4000) in CSV files for each combination of learner, task, tuning measure, and resampling iteration |

Folders `harrell_c` and `rcll` contain the individual files from which `aggr_scores` and `scores` are created and are therefore only an intermediate product.
Similarly, files starting with `bmr_` (`BenchmarkResult`) or `bma_` (`BenchmarkAggr`) are intermediate results and are only relevant if these `mlr3` objects are specifically required.

See also [the table of measures](metadata.qmd) for a list of measures and their abbreviated and full names.
